## QUESTION 4 and 5:
""" Given:
        prob of red = 0.55
        prob of green = 0.45
"""
"""
    find :
    Question 4 : drawing one sample of 10 marbles prob of all being green 
"""
mu = 0.55
NMarbels = 10
ans=1.0
for i in range(NMarbels):
    ans = ans*(1-mu)

#print ans

"""QUestion 5:calcualte probability that at least one of samples has v =0."""
## solution can be think as calculating sampels 1- prob(no samples has v=0)
samples = 1000

def probSampleHavingAtleastOneRED(proRED,sampleSize):
    ans = 1.0
    for i in xrange(sampleSize):
        ans*=(1-mu)
    return 1-ans
ans = 1.0
for i in xrange(samples):
    ans*=probSampleHavingAtleastOneRED(0.55,10)

print 1-ans
